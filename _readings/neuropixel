NEUROPIXEL - Feynmann learning!
Concept: Optogenetics  
Summary: Light-controlled modulation of neuron activity via opsins  
Mechanism: DNA → Opsin → 光 → Ion Channel → Action potential 
```
code?
```
Analogy: transistor gate → light as gate voltage  
Questions: Can we map opsin spectral sensitivity to cortical column layers?  
My Insight: e.g.  one sentence
