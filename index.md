    <h1>Tony Chae</h1>
    <p>I’m an engineer and philosopher exploring how brain–computer interfaces can
    bridge perception, intelligence, and meaning. My current work focuses on
    <strong>closed-loop neurostimulation</strong> and AI-guided signal decoding for neural prosthetics.</p>

    <p>I lead <em>Longhorn Neurotech</em> at UT Austin and conduct DARPA-funded research on
    EEG and ultrasound-based neural interfaces. I write here to document concepts at the intersection of
    neuroscience, AI, and philosophy of mind.</p>
